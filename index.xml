      <description>For some time, my trusted all in one remote control was having problems. Some buttons were not working very well : the &amp;ldquo;Watch TV&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;TV&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo;.
The &amp;ldquo;Watch TV&amp;rdquo; required very high pressure, and the two other where not working about half of the time, independently of the pressure on the button.
For the &amp;ldquo;Watch TV&amp;rdquo;, after testing the contact directly on the pads of the remote, it was clear that the problem came from the black conductive pad on the button.</description>

      <description>Introduction Since I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, I wanted to control remotely two floor lamps in my house. I bought some cheap RF outlets, but I did not want to have another ugly looking and always lost remote control in the house. So a clean solution was needed !
This is the kind of RF plug I used :
                  The idea was to add a standard light switch in an existing box.</description>

      <title>NumWorks controlling a pyboard rover</title>

      <description>Just a small video about controlling a MicroPython pyboard based rover by a NumWorks calculator.
This is one of the rover my wife is using to teach Python programming in her high school. They were modified to use a pyboard instead of the original arduino controller using a custom PCB.

      <title>NumWorks UART Over USB port</title>

      <description>Some people are complaining about the lack of connectivity to the outside world from the calculator, but in fact it is pretty simple to change that.
According to the calculator schematics, the USB port of the calculator is wired to PA11 and PA12 of the STM32F412. We have this in the datasheet about these pins :
So, it is possible to map an UART on the USB port D+ and D-.</description>

      <title>OpenOCD on the Raspberry Pi inside a NumWorks calculator</title>

      <description>In my previous post I added a Raspberry Pi Zero inside the calculator. Why not use also it to program/debug the calculator firmware ?
What I have done is basically to follow this adafruit tutorial.
I soldered only SWDIO to Raspberry Pi #24 and SWCLK to Raspberry Pi #25. This seems to be enough, and the reset button of the calculator is not far away if needed.
Using the following OpenOCD script, it is now possible to debug or program the calculator over the air !</description>

      <description>I was having a Raspberry Pi Zero sitting on my desk for a long time, searching for something to do with it. I also wanted to to learm STM32, mainly DMA and interrups. As the caculator is powered by an STM32F412, why not put them together ?
TL;DR, the result:   The idea was to add an application on the calculator, which will display the output of the Raspberry Pi, and send keystroke from the keyboard to it.</description>
