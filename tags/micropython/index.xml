      <description>Just a small video about controlling a MicroPython pyboard based rover by a NumWorks calculator.
This is one of the rover my wife is using to teach Python programming in her high school. They were modified to use a pyboard instead of the original arduino controller using a custom PCB.

      <description>Some people are complaining about the lack of connectivity to the outside world from the calculator, but in fact it is pretty simple to change that.
According to the calculator schematics, the USB port of the calculator is wired to PA11 and PA12 of the STM32F412. We have this in the datasheet about these pins :
So, it is possible to map an UART on the USB port D+ and D-.</description>
